      <h4>Why can't I edit older activity records?</h4>
      <p>
        From Jan 1 2017 CPD activities were further divided into <i>types</i>. This changed the way the data is stored
        behind the scenes and so, older records do not have a <i>type</i> associated with them. In the unusual case that
        older records need to be modified you can create a new record, or duplicate the old record, and then delete the
        original.
